# Privacy Policy for ChatGPT WordSmith

**Effective Date:** [10/10/2024]

Welcome to the Privacy Policy for ChatGPT WordSmith (hereinafter referred to as "ChatGPT WordSmith", "we", "us", or "our").
Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how **ChatGPT WordSmith** ("the Extension") collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use the extension. 
We are committed to complying with all applicable user data policies and ensuring transparency about the handling of data.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly described in this policy. The Extension may access and store certain information locally on your device to improve user experience, as outlined below.

- **Local Data Storage:** The Extension may store settings, preferences, and themes locally within your browser for a more personalized experience. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted externally.
  
- **Non-Personal Data:** We may collect anonymized usage data (such as error logs) to help improve the Extension’s performance and troubleshoot issues. This data is used solely for internal operations and does not include any personal or sensitive information.

## 2. Permissions and Data Usage

In accordance with Chrome Web Store’s "minimum permissions" policy, we request only the permissions necessary to provide the core features of the Extension. We limit the use of any data collected as follows:

- **Single Purpose Use:** Data collected by the Extension is used exclusively to improve the functionality and user experience of the product. We do not use the data for any purposes unrelated to the functionality described on our store listing page or user interface.

- **Prohibited Data Collection:** We do not collect, use, or transfer any browsing history or personal information unless it is required for a specific user-facing feature. Any collection will be prominently disclosed in the user interface, in line with store policies.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Data Transfers

We do not sell or share your data with third parties, except in the following circumstances:

- **Necessary Transfers:** Data may be transferred to third parties if required to provide the core functionality of the Extension, comply with applicable laws, or protect against fraud or abuse.
  
- **Prohibited Transfers:** We do not transfer, sell, or use data for personalized advertising, user tracking, or to third parties such as data brokers or advertisers.

## 4. User Control

You retain full control over the Extension’s data usage. You can disable or uninstall the Extension at any time through your browser's extension management settings. Additionally, you can clear locally stored data by resetting the Extension or clearing your browser’s cache.

## 5. Data Security

We take security seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect your data. However, as the Extension primarily handles data locally on your device, the security of your data is largely determined by your browser and system configurations.

## 6. Limited Use of Data

Our use of any user data complies with the **Chrome Web Store Limited Use policy**, which mandates that:

- We use data only to improve user-facing features of the Extension.
- Data is never used for personalized advertisements or sold to third parties.
- Humans do not read user data unless for specific consented operations like technical support or security purposes.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Effective Date" at the top of this document will be updated accordingly. We encourage users to review the policy periodically to stay informed of any changes.
